### Outcome
To have working breaks and no extra parts left over.

### General Warnings
Don't let the car fall off of the jack. 

### Steps
1. Look for a good place to start

	Note: It is best to be sure that the vehicle is in a safe place for the duration of the procedure.  

2. Disconnect the Neg. Battery terminal

3. Position the Tire chucks behind the rear wheels

4. Using your TOOL(lug wrench), Loosen each of the lug nuts, but do not completely remove them.

	Note: this uses the weight of the vehicle to push against. If the wheels were already off of the ground, the tire would spin while loosening the tire lugs

5. Raise and support the front end of the vehicle and rest it on jacks stands.

6. Finish removing the tire lug nuts, and place them in your magnetic dish.

7. Remove the wheel

	Note: If the tire has not been removed for quite some time, it maybe necessary to use force, 

8. Do something with the PART(brake pads).

9. Do something with the PART(caliper grease).
