# To Do

- Improve .url source format for retrieval of upstream resources
    - Support files inside of zips and tarballs
    - Support files inside of git clones
    - Support for checking an MD5SUM of a downloaded resource
- Even though I suspect GNU Make can obviate all need for Grunt and Bower, those tools have become part of the workflow for many developers. Show how we can play nice with them, incorporating them into the build pipeline.
- Pattern for collation of pages
    - Feeds: Atom, RSS
    - Google Sitemap
- Makefile target for building example site into gh-pages branch + committing
    - Check for no local modifications/changes first
    - Store commit hash of source in rendered output
- Makefile target for various means of deployment
- Various demo sites to quickly bootstrap a site. Themes?
- Demo site using bootstrap
- Employ m4 frozen state files for speed
